# BeWorking Backend - Production-Ready Authentication Best Practices

This backend uses Java (Spring Boot) and follows best practices for secure, maintainable, and scalable authentication and authorization. Here are the key practices we are implementing:

## 1. User Entity with Role Field
- The `User` entity includes a `role` field (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`) to distinguish admin users from regular users.
- This enables role-based access control throughout the application.

## 2. DTOs for Authentication
- We use `AuthRequest` and `AuthResponse` Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to structure login requests and responses.
- This ensures clean, maintainable, and type-safe API contracts.

## 3. AuthController with Role-Based Endpoints
- The `AuthController` exposes endpoints such as `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/admin/login`.
- Endpoints validate credentials and roles, returning appropriate responses.

## 4. AuthService for Business Logic
- Authentication and user validation logic is separated into an `AuthService` class.
- This keeps controllers clean and makes business logic reusable and testable.

## 5. JWT Token Generation
- On successful login, the backend generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless, secure authentication.
- The token encodes user identity and role, and is used by the frontend for authenticated requests.

## 6. Spring Security Configuration
- We configure Spring Security to:
  - Protect sensitive endpoints
  - Require authentication and proper roles for admin routes
  - Validate JWT tokens on incoming requests

## 7. Environment Variables and Secrets
- Sensitive configuration (e.g., JWT secret, DB credentials) is stored in environment variables, not in code.

## 8. Error Handling and Status Codes
- The API returns clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for authentication failures and unauthorized access.

## 9. Password Hashing
- User passwords are securely hashed and never stored in plain text.

## 10. Extensible and Maintainable Structure
- The codebase is organized for easy extension (e.g., adding OAuth, multi-factor auth, etc.).

**These practices ensure your backend is secure, robust, and ready for production deployment.**
