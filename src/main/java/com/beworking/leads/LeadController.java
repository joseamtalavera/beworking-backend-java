/**
 * REST controller that accepts lead submissions and persists them.
 *
 * <p>Behavior summary:
 * - Incoming payload is validated by Spring's bean validation (the request DTO is annotated with
 *   validation constraints). Note: validation is triggered before this method executes, so the
 *   request must already conform to constraints (for example, a trimmed and well-formed email).
 * - This controller performs application-level sanitization and normalization on fields before
 *   persisting: it strips HTML from the name via {@link SanitizationUtils#sanitizeText(String)},
 *   trims the email, and normalizes the phone via {@link SanitizationUtils#sanitizePhone(String)}.
 * - After saving the lead, a {@link LeadCreatedEvent} is published so background listeners (email,
 *   HubSpot sync, etc.) can react asynchronously.
 *
 * <p>Testing notes:
 * - Tests that exercise this controller should send values that pass bean validation (trimmed
 *   email, valid phone). The controller's sanitization is applied before persisting, and tests
 *   typically assert on the saved entity or the repository interaction to verify normalization.

     *
     * Notes:
     * - Sanitization/normalization (HTML stripping, trimming, phone normalization) is performed
     *   here before saving. Because validation runs before this method, tests must provide
     *   inputs that already satisfy validation rules (for example a well-formed email).
     * - Publishes {@link LeadCreatedEvent} after successful persistence so downstream listeners
     *   can handle email sending / external sync.
